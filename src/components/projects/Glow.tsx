          Every November, Eindhoven hosts a festival of light art throughout the
          city that attracts many visitors. Over the past 15 years, from 45,000
          visitors in the beginning to over 770,000 visitors in 2019, GLOW has
          grown from a week-long light art festival to a city symbol of
          Eindhoven.

          In the sunmmer of 2021, we, the group members from different majors,
          got together to brainstorm an interactive art installation. The idea
          later turned into 80 illuminated mushrooms spread across the campus,
          which, through interaction, will guide visitors to the next
          interactive installation.

          A path full of magical luminescent mushrooms. Enchanting interaction.
          A unique and beautiful way to find your way. That is how visitors to
          Eindhoven University of Technology are guided through the site during
          GLOW, from one installation to another. Between all these
          installations, that's where the Wayfinding project shines. The
          mushrooms form an interactive system. Visitors can activate a
          mushroom, after which it glows and spreads its 'spores', which
          activate another mushroom nearby. This creates a chain reaction, which
          submerges the entire path - or parts of it - in a sea of ​​​​light.

          Thrilled to be part of GLOW's creative journey! Designing the
          illustrations has been like dancing with neon lights, immersing myself
          in vibrant and playful colors. GLOW never fails to impress with
          brilliant ideas and amazing projects. Can't wait to see what's coming
          next!
